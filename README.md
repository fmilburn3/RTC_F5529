# RTC_F5529
Demonstration of the RTC on the MSP430F5529 LaunchPad using Energia.

This is a lightly modified version of a library posted by b@tto on 43oh.com.  The example shows how to set the time, blink an LED every second, call a user specified function on a user specified interval, and call a user specified function at a specified time (alarm time).

The code has not been rigorously tested.
